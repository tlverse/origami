Description: A general framework for the application of cross-validation schemes
    to particular functions. By allowing arbitrary lists of results, origami
    accommodates a range of cross-validation applications. This implementation
    was first described by Coyle and Hejazi (2018) <doi:10.21105/joss.00512>.
