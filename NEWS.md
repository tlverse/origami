# origami 1.0.5
* Addition of `glmnet` to package `Suggests` since used in the vignette.
* Resolve issue stemming from the partial matching of argument names
  (https://github.com/tlverse/origami/issues/56) by specifying throughout.

# origami 1.0.4
* Fix the incorrect use of `future.apply` by including `future.seed = TRUE`,
   as per https://github.com/tlverse/origami/issues/48.
* Fixes to `folds_rolling_origin_pooled` and `folds_rolling_window_pooled`,
   as per https://github.com/tlverse/origami/pull/50.
* Sped up all pooled time-series fold functions with `lapply`.
* All pooled time-series fold functions (`folds_rolling_origin_pooled`,
   `folds_rolling_window_pooled`, `folds_vfold_rolling_origin_pooled`,
   `folds_vfold_rolling_window_pooled`) now allow for variability in the
   number of observations for each independent unit (i.e., the subject).
* Added test for pooled time-series cross-validation with multi-unit time-series
   to test the update above. In this test, the total number of observations
   and the time-points for which there are observations varies across the units.

# origami 1.0.3
* A maintenance release addressing reported issues, including changes to unit
   tests that relied on Suggested packages dependencies.

# origami 1.0.2
* Adds new functionality for cross-validation with time-series, especially
   functionality for pooling time-series data. This includes the new functions
   `folds_rolling_origin_pooled`, `folds_rolling_window_pooled`,
   `folds_vfold_rolling_origin_pooled`, `folds_vfold_rolling_window_pooled`.

# origami 1.0.1
* Adds a simple check of the current R version in the unit tests in the file
   `tests/testthat/test-overall.R` to use appropriate hard-coded values that
   depend on the R version. Note that these differ between R < 3.6.0 and
   R > 3.6.0 due to an important change in the default PRNG.

# origami 1.0.0
* Adds a new function `folds2foldvec` for easy conversion between the folds
    structure used by `origami` and other packages (e.g., `glmnet`).
* Adds an option to use `lapply` instead of `future_lapply`, for compatibility
   with other packages in a custom parallelization framework.
* Calls `future_lapply` from the new more modular package `future.apply` rather
   than from `future`, matching the author's recommendation.

# origami 0.8.0
* First CRAN release.
* Removed `origami_SuperLearner` functionality temporarily.
